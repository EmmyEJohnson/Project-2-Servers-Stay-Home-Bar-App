In the age of social distancing, BarHop allows users to socialize in their favorite watering hole and share drinks with friends.

UI - 

When you enter the site, log into BarHop with google Auth email. Upon authorization you will be redirected to the home page and prompted to enter one of the available bars.

Choose which bar to enter based on the short video description.

After choosing which bar to enter, user is redirected to the next page where they will be able to interact with other users in that bar. 

Comment, choose a drink, and contribute to the forum. 

If you grow tired of your current bar, hop on to the next one and find a new group of friends. 

Logout when you are done drinking and your profile will be saved for the next day.
